        <h2 class="subTitle">prologue</h2>
        <p class="text">Two households, both alike in dignity,<br>
            In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,<br>
            From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,<br>
            Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.<br>
            From forth the fatal loins of these two foes<br>
            A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;<br>
            Whose misadventured piteous overthrows<br>
            Do with their death bury their parents' strife.<br>
            The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,<br>
            And the continuance of their parents' rage,<br>
            Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,<br>
            Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;<br>
            The which if you with patient ears attend,<br>
            What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.</p>
